# DreamLister
An iOS app using CoreData, developed during an iOS course on Udemy.

The app allows users to make a list of the things they wished they had. Users can add, edit and delete items. Users can assign their own photo from the camera roll, assign it to a store and a category. In the main view, they can sort their items by date, price, alphabetically and type.
